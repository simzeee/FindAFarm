## Overview

FindAFarm is a Air BnB/Hip Camp clone designed to allow guests to view details, photos, and descriptions of farms from around the country in order to book trips at individual owned farms. There are two times of users: the guest, and the farmer. Farmers have the ability to created, edit, and delete their farms while guests can create, edit, and delete bookings. Guests can become hosts/farmers in order to make extra money sharing their unique farm experience.

Users are greeted with a splash page in which they can search via different ammenities for the farm experience they desire.
They can use the NavBar in order to see their past bookings or view a list of all farms currently available.

Users can also interact with a searchable map and click on whatever farm they would like to visit.

Then, once a farm is selected, the guest can view between one and 5 photos as well as details concerning what the farm offers in order to get an idea for what staying at this farm would be like.

Farmers can see their current posted farm and edit each feature individually. When creating a farm, they must choose and input the various characteristics as as well as photos and amenities that they will offer.
